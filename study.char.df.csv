""Before coming here, you had to meet two requirements, namely not having
eaten for the last 4 hours or so and not having taken drugs over the last 2 weeks.
These conditions being fulfilled, I will now proceed to teach you a Zen medi-
tation technique.
During the following days, you will repeat this exercise twice a day, for 20
minutes, before the morning and evening meals. If it is impossible at that
particular time, try to do it a little later.
Thus, you should find a calm and normally lit room, somewhere between bright
daylight and darkness. Try to avoid being disturbed during the exercise by
the telephone or any other loud noise.
Then, sit in the most comfortable position for you, your spinal cord straight
and leaning against a flat vertical surface, so as not t o fall asleep. Take care
to free your abdomen to facilitate respiration.
After that, close your eyes and wait half a minute before starting the exercise
itself which consists in counting your respiration (count 1 for inspiration and
expiration) from 1 to 10, and start again at 1, and so on. If you lose count
during the exercise, do not try to recall where you were but simply start over
at 1 and keep on.
During the course of the exercise, you will notice that thoughts, feelings,
sensory distractions will appear; you should not try t o fight these but wait
until it becomes easy to resume the exercise.
After 20 minutes, stop the exercise and wait 3 more minutes before opening
your eyes.
You will now do the exercise in my presence; when the 20 minutes are over,
I will let you know and you will reopen your eyes 3 minutes later. You can
start now .""

- advanced technique:
""I will now teach you the advanced meditation technique which complements
the one you have been practising over the past 15 days.
During the past 2 weeks, I asked you to count your respirations from 1 to 10.
Now you will stop counting in order to concentrate on the breathing process
itself. You will breathe as usual without any effort or restraint. Your attention
should be on your inspiration and expiration. Follow the entrance of the air
through the nose down to the lungs and from there toward the outside.
Your breathing may be long or short. This is not important. Breathe naturally.
The only important thing is that when your breathing is short, you are aware
of it and the same when it is long.
You will now proceed, together, according to this new modality.""

""Centering meditation is based on an early Christian mystic
practice called centering prayer developed by the Desert Fathers
and Mothers in the third century (Keating, 2002). The focus
of centering prayer is interior silence which the early Christian
mystics to develop deeper communion with God. Like other
concentration meditations that use a symbol for focus (Goleman,
1988), practitioners select a word or symbol they hold sacred
(e.g., Shalom, hope) and use it to bring back their mind from
distractions. However, unlike many other meditations, centering
prayer focuses not on the mind but rather areas of spiritual
connection. In completative texts, it is called the “return of
the heart” (Pennington, 1980, p. 62) or “attention of the heart”
(Bourgeault, 2004, p. 113). The term centering stems from the
idea that the meditator finds their core center and awakens to
awareness of divine presence inside them.""

""1. Select a word or symbol that you consider spiritually
grounding for you (e.g., a name for God or spiritual concepts
like Shalom, hope, or joy) and represents your intention to
connect with what is spiritual to you.
2. At the beginning of the meditation, sit down comfortably with
your eyes closed (preferably away from external distractions)
and silently introduce your sacred word or symbol.
3. After you do this, you’ll probably notice distracting thoughts
emerging or mind wandering. That’s okay. When you notice
yourself becoming distracted, just ever-so-gently reintroduce
your sacred word or symbol.
4. At the end of your meditation, just sit and rest in silence or say
a prayer for a few moments.""
