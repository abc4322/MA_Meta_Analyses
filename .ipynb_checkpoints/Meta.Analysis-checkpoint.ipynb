       "2  \"Contemplative practices are generally personal pursuits that intensify, focus, and\\nquiet the mind (Center for Contemplative Mind in Society [CCMS], n.d.a). Finley (2000)\\nfurther develops this definition by adding a heart dimension. He explains â\\200œa\\ncontemplative practice is any act, habitually entered into with your whole heart, as a way\\nof awakening, deepening, and sustaining contemplative experience of the inherent\\nholiness of the present momentâ\\200\\235 (p. 46). As shown in Table 1 (CCMS, n.d.b), numerous\\noptions exist for contemplative experiences.\"\\n\"While numerous contemplative practices are noted\\nin the Tree of Contemplative Practices (CCMS, n.d.b) and in Eastern traditions (e.g.,\\nBuddhism, Hinduism), meditation is the most common form of contemplative practice.\\nWhile numerous methods of meditation occur, the vast majority fall along a continuum\\nbetween two categories, either concentrative, which is turning-off, or mindfulness, which\\nis opening-up oneâ\\200\\231s awareness to the external world (Cahn & Polich, 2006; Kabat-Zinn et\\nal., 1992; Ornstein, 2008). In Buddhism these two categories are referred to as shamatha,\\nmeaning calming, and vipashyana, meaning insight or transformation (Thurman, 2006).\\nWhen turning-off awareness, thoughts and sensory responses related to the environment\\nare restricted by deeply focusing the mind on a single point such as a mantra, prayer,\\noneâ\\200\\231s breath, or a meditation object such as a flower, flame, or religious article. While\\nthis type of meditation is also demonstrated in other religious customs, the definition and\\npurpose differ from one faith tradition to another. When practicing centering prayer in the\\nChristian tradition a mantra is only used to bring oneâ\\200\\231s attention to the present moment\\nand it is released once the mind is present (Keating, 2009).\\nThe second category of meditation, opening-up of awareness, is sometimes\\nidentified as mindfulness or insight meditation. It involves being intensely attuned to\\noneâ\\200\\231s consciousness and senses. Opening-up meditation is approached with a spirit of\\ncuriosity and acceptance while refraining from judgment. With concentrated attention in\\nthe present moment, the practitioner follows and observes thoughts and sensations with\\nthe goal of insight through self-observation (Hofmann et al., 2010; Kabat-Zinn et al.,\\n1992; Ornstein, 2008; Thurman, 2006). Christian contemplation, a profound spiritual and\\ndivine union with God (Keating, 2003), may loosely be compared to opening-up\\nmeditation. However, according to Keating contemplation is an imprecise practice that\\ncannot be controlled. When engaging in contemplation, the practitioner experiences a\\ndeepened encounter with the Divine transcending self with the intention of receiving\\nenlightenment. Centering prayer may be one vehicle of entry to a level of God\\nconsciousness (Keating, 2009; Rohr, 1999).\"\n",

       "Intervention.1 - initial technique:\\n\"Before coming here, you had to meet two requirements, namely not having\\neaten for the last 4 hours or so and not having taken drugs over the last 2 weeks.\\nThese conditions being fulfilled, I will now proceed to teach you a Zen medi-\\ntation technique.\\nDuring the following days, you will repeat this exercise twice a day, for 20\\nminutes, before the morning and evening meals. If it is impossible at that\\nparticular time, try to do it a little later.\\nThus, you should find a calm and normally lit room, somewhere between bright\\ndaylight and darkness. Try to avoid being disturbed during the exercise by\\nthe telephone or any other loud noise.\\nThen, sit in the most comfortable position for you, your spinal cord straight\\nand leaning against a flat vertical surface, so as not t o fall asleep. Take care\\nto free your abdomen to facilitate respiration.\\nAfter that, close your eyes and wait half a minute before starting the exercise\\nitself which consists in counting your respiration (count 1 for inspiration and\\nexpiration) from 1 to 10, and start again at 1, and so on. If you lose count\\nduring the exercise, do not try to recall where you were but simply start over\\nat 1 and keep on.\\nDuring the course of the exercise, you will notice that thoughts, feelings,\\nsensory distractions will appear; you should not try t o fight these but wait\\nuntil it becomes easy to resume the exercise.\\nAfter 20 minutes, stop the exercise and wait 3 more minutes before opening\\nyour eyes.\\nYou will now do the exercise in my presence; when the 20 minutes are over,\\nI will let you know and you will reopen your eyes 3 minutes later. You can\\nstart now .\"\\n\\n- advanced technique:\\n\"I will now teach you the advanced meditation technique which complements\\nthe one you have been practising over the past 15 days.\\nDuring the past 2 weeks, I asked you to count your respirations from 1 to 10.\\nNow you will stop counting in order to concentrate on the breathing process\\nitself. You will breathe as usual without any effort or restraint. Your attention\\nshould be on your inspiration and expiration. Follow the entrance of the air\\nthrough the nose down to the lungs and from there toward the outside.\\nYour breathing may be long or short. This is not important. Breathe naturally.\\nThe only important thing is that when your breathing is short, you are aware\\nof it and the same when it is long.\\nYou will now proceed, together, according to this new modality.\"\n",

       "Intervention.1 \"Centering meditation is based on an early Christian mystic\\npractice called centering prayer developed by the Desert Fathers\\nand Mothers in the third century (Keating, 2002). The focus\\nof centering prayer is interior silence which the early Christian\\nmystics to develop deeper communion with God. Like other\\nconcentration meditations that use a symbol for focus (Goleman,\\n1988), practitioners select a word or symbol they hold sacred\\n(e.g., Shalom, hope) and use it to bring back their mind from\\ndistractions. However, unlike many other meditations, centering\\nprayer focuses not on the mind but rather areas of spiritual\\nconnection. In completative texts, it is called the â\\200œreturn of\\nthe heartâ\\200\\235 (Pennington, 1980, p. 62) or â\\200œattention of the heartâ\\200\\235\\n(Bourgeault, 2004, p. 113). The term centering stems from the\\nidea that the meditator finds their core center and awakens to\\nawareness of divine presence inside them.\"\\n\\n\"1. Select a word or symbol that you consider spiritually\\ngrounding for you (e.g., a name for God or spiritual concepts\\nlike Shalom, hope, or joy) and represents your intention to\\nconnect with what is spiritual to you.\\n2. At the beginning of the meditation, sit down comfortably with\\nyour eyes closed (preferably away from external distractions)\\nand silently introduce your sacred word or symbol.\\n3. After you do this, youâ\\200\\231ll probably notice distracting thoughts\\nemerging or mind wandering. Thatâ\\200\\231s okay. When you notice\\nyourself becoming distracted, just ever-so-gently reintroduce\\nyour sacred word or symbol.\\n4. At the end of your meditation, just sit and rest in silence or say\\na prayer for a few moments.\"\n",

In Buddhism these two categories are referred to as shamatha,\\nmeaning calming, and vipashyana, meaning insight or transformation (Thurman, 2006).\\nWhen turning-off awareness, thoughts and sensory responses related to the environment\\nare restricted by deeply focusing the mind on a single point such as a mantra, prayer,\\noneâ\\200\\231s breath, or a meditation object such as a flower, flame, or religious article. While\\nthis type of meditation is also demonstrated in other religious customs, the definition and\\npurpose differ from one faith tradition to another. When practicing centering prayer in the\\nChristian tradition a mantra is only used to bring oneâ\\200\\231s attention to the present moment\\nand it is released once the mind is present (Keating, 2009).\\nThe second category of meditation, opening-up of awareness, is sometimes\\nidentified as mindfulness or insight meditation. It involves being intensely attuned to\\noneâ\\200\\231s consciousness and senses. Opening-up meditation is approached with a spirit of\\ncuriosity and acceptance while refraining from judgment. With concentrated attention in\\nthe present moment, the practitioner follows and observes thoughts and sensations with\\nthe goal of insight through self-observation (Hofmann et al., 2010; Kabat-Zinn et al.,\\n1992; Ornstein, 2008; Thurman, 2006). Christian contemplation, a profound spiritual and\\ndivine union with God (Keating, 2003), may loosely be compared to opening-up\\nmeditation. However, according to Keating contemplation is an imprecise practice that\\ncannot be controlled. When engaging in contemplation, the practitioner experiences a\\ndeepened encounter with the Divine transcending self with the intention of receiving\\nenlightenment. Centering prayer may be one vehicle of entry to a level of God\\nconsciousness (Keating, 2009; Rohr, 1999).\"\n",

       "Intervention.1 - initial technique:\\n\"Before coming here, you had to meet two requirements, namely not having\\neaten for the last 4 hours or so and not having taken drugs over the last 2 weeks.\\nThese conditions being fulfilled, I will now proceed to teach you a Zen medi-\\ntation technique.\\nDuring the following days, you will repeat this exercise twice a day, for 20\\nminutes, before the morning and evening meals. If it is impossible at that\\nparticular time, try to do it a little later.\\nThus, you should find a calm and normally lit room, somewhere between bright\\ndaylight and darkness. Try to avoid being disturbed during the exercise by\\nthe telephone or any other loud noise.\\nThen, sit in the most comfortable position for you, your spinal cord straight\\nand leaning against a flat vertical surface, so as not t o fall asleep. Take care\\nto free your abdomen to facilitate respiration.\\nAfter that, close your eyes and wait half a minute before starting the exercise\\nitself which consists in counting your respiration (count 1 for inspiration and\\nexpiration) from 1 to 10, and start again at 1, and so on. If you lose count\\nduring the exercise, do not try to recall where you were but simply start over\\nat 1 and keep on.\\nDuring the course of the exercise, you will notice that thoughts, feelings,\\nsensory distractions will appear; you should not try t o fight these but wait\\nuntil it becomes easy to resume the exercise.\\nAfter 20 minutes, stop the exercise and wait 3 more minutes before opening\\nyour eyes.\\nYou will now do the exercise in my presence; when the 20 minutes are over,\\nI will let you know and you will reopen your eyes 3 minutes later. You can\\nstart now .\"\\n\\n- advanced technique:\\n\"I will now teach you the advanced meditation technique which complements\\nthe one you have been practising over the past 15 days.\\nDuring the past 2 weeks, I asked you to count your respirations from 1 to 10.\\nNow you will stop counting in order to concentrate on the breathing process\\nitself. You will breathe as usual without any effort or restraint. Your attention\\nshould be on your inspiration and expiration. Follow the entrance of the air\\nthrough the nose down to the lungs and from there toward the outside.\\nYour breathing may be long or short. This is not important. Breathe naturally.\\nThe only important thing is that when your breathing is short, you are aware\\nof it and the same when it is long.\\nYou will now proceed, together, according to this new modality.\"\n",

       "Intervention.1 \"Centering meditation is based on an early Christian mystic\\npractice called centering prayer developed by the Desert Fathers\\nand Mothers in the third century (Keating, 2002). The focus\\nof centering prayer is interior silence which the early Christian\\nmystics to develop deeper communion with God. Like other\\nconcentration meditations that use a symbol for focus (Goleman,\\n1988), practitioners select a word or symbol they hold sacred\\n(e.g., Shalom, hope) and use it to bring back their mind from\\ndistractions. However, unlike many other meditations, centering\\nprayer focuses not on the mind but rather areas of spiritual\\nconnection. In completative texts, it is called the â\\200œreturn of\\nthe heartâ\\200\\235 (Pennington, 1980, p. 62) or â\\200œattention of the heartâ\\200\\235\\n(Bourgeault, 2004, p. 113). The term centering stems from the\\nidea that the meditator finds their core center and awakens to\\nawareness of divine presence inside them.\"\\n\\n\"1. Select a word or symbol that you consider spiritually\\ngrounding for you (e.g., a name for God or spiritual concepts\\nlike Shalom, hope, or joy) and represents your intention to\\nconnect with what is spiritual to you.\\n2. At the beginning of the meditation, sit down comfortably with\\nyour eyes closed (preferably away from external distractions)\\nand silently introduce your sacred word or symbol.\\n3. After you do this, youâ\\200\\231ll probably notice distracting thoughts\\nemerging or mind wandering. Thatâ\\200\\231s okay. When you notice\\nyourself becoming distracted, just ever-so-gently reintroduce\\nyour sacred word or symbol.\\n4. At the end of your meditation, just sit and rest in silence or say\\na prayer for a few moments.\"\n",
