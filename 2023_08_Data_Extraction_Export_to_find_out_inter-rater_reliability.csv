of awakening, deepening, and sustaining contemplative experience of the inherent

options exist for contemplative experiences.""
""While numerous contemplative practices are noted
in the Tree of Contemplative Practices (CCMS, n.d.b) and in Eastern traditions (e.g.,
Buddhism, Hinduism), meditation is the most common form of contemplative practice.
While numerous methods of meditation occur, the vast majority fall along a continuum
between two categories, either concentrative, which is turning-off, or mindfulness, which
is opening-up one’s awareness to the external world (Cahn & Polich, 2006; Kabat-Zinn et
al., 1992; Ornstein, 2008). In Buddhism these two categories are referred to as shamatha,
meaning calming, and vipashyana, meaning insight or transformation (Thurman, 2006).
When turning-off awareness, thoughts and sensory responses related to the environment
are restricted by deeply focusing the mind on a single point such as a mantra, prayer,
one’s breath, or a meditation object such as a flower, flame, or religious article. While
this type of meditation is also demonstrated in other religious customs, the definition and
purpose differ from one faith tradition to another. When practicing centering prayer in the
Christian tradition a mantra is only used to bring one’s attention to the present moment
and it is released once the mind is present (Keating, 2009).
The second category of meditation, opening-up of awareness, is sometimes
identified as mindfulness or insight meditation. It involves being intensely attuned to
one’s consciousness and senses. Opening-up meditation is approached with a spirit of
curiosity and acceptance while refraining from judgment. With concentrated attention in
the present moment, the practitioner follows and observes thoughts and sensations with
the goal of insight through self-observation (Hofmann et al., 2010; Kabat-Zinn et al.,
1992; Ornstein, 2008; Thurman, 2006). Christian contemplation, a profound spiritual and
divine union with God (Keating, 2003), may loosely be compared to opening-up
meditation. However, according to Keating contemplation is an imprecise practice that
cannot be controlled. When engaging in contemplation, the practitioner experiences a
deepened encounter with the Divine transcending self with the intention of receiving
enlightenment. Centering prayer may be one vehicle of entry to a level of God
consciousness (Keating, 2009; Rohr, 1999).""",Yes,"""While numerous methods of meditation occur, the vast majority fall along a continuum

definitions appear to be grounded in the individual work of Hans Selye (1956), a
prominent endocrinologist, and Richard S. Lazarus (1966), a well-known psychologist
both interested in the scholarship of stress. The generally accepted definition attributed to
Lazarus defines stress as the emotional response when life “demands exceed the personal
and social resources the individual is able to mobilize” (Stress Management from Mind
Tools, n.d., para. 7).
According to the American Institute of Stress (American Institute of Stress [AIS],
n.d.) stress can be categorized as (a) acute, an episodic stress experience exhibited as an
immediate fight or flight response to circumstances such as earning a bad grade or
frustration with a roommate; (b) chronic, ongoing and often ignored experiences that may
be triggered by issues such as tuition bills and unhappy relationships; (c) eustress, stress
associated with positive events such as an athletic performance or excitement about an
upcoming event; or, (d) distress, constant daily stress related to depression and financial
difficulties that cannot be disregarded. All types of stress may have a physiological
response, but chronic stress is the primary culprit as it is ongoing stress that has not been
reconciled. Virtually all body systems are vulnerable to stress including the nervous,
musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and reproductive
systems (AIS, n.d.).""","","","","","","",Stress,"","","","","","",1,"",The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS),0 - 40,v,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",Yes,T-Test for independent Samples; Other: ANCOVA,Yes,Phenomenological approach,Yes,"",Partial η²,"",20.3333,5.04315,21,"","","","","","",19.6500,5.60334,20,"",17.1429,5.45239,21,"","","","","","",22.1000,4.25379,20,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",0.001,0.261,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","See ""Table 18.

n.d.) stress can be categorized as (a) acute, an episodic stress experience exhibited as an
immediate fight or flight response to circumstances such as earning a bad grade or
frustration with a roommate; (b) chronic, ongoing and often ignored experiences that may
be triggered by issues such as tuition bills and unhappy relationships; (c) eustress, stress
associated with positive events such as an athletic performance or excitement about an
upcoming event; or, (d) distress, constant daily stress related to depression and financial
difficulties that cannot be disregarded. All types of stress may have a physiological
response, but chronic stress is the primary culprit as it is ongoing stress that has not been
reconciled. Virtually all body systems are vulnerable to stress including the nervous,
musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and reproductive
systems (AIS, n.d.).""","","","","","","",Stress,"","","","","","",1,"",The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS),0 - 40,v,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",Yes,T-Test for independent Samples; Other: ANCOVA,Yes,Phenomenological approach,Yes,"",Partial η²,"",20.3333,5.04315,21,"","","","","","",19.6500,5.60334,20,"",17.1429,5.45239,21,"","","","","","",22.1000,4.25379,20,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",0.001,0.261,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","detailed informations see ""Table 18.

exercises   proposed  during   the   session   and   received   a   list   of
exercises to carry out at home for the following week (combination
of mandatory and self-selected exercises for a duration equivalent
to 5*
20 minutes). At the end of the program, participants were
asked to identify exercises that worked the best for them (which is
not  necessary  equal  to  their  preferred  ones,  [69],  see  discussion
section   for   more   details),   and   were   strongly   encouraged   to
continue  them  after  the  end  of  the  intervention","This   training   was   a
French adaptation of the training proposed by Fredrickson et al.
[65] and was created on the basis of the material we received from
S. Finkel, the LKM trainer in this study. The only difference was
in relation to the duration of the ‘‘on-site’’ sessions that were two
hours long (as opposed to 60 minutes in the session proposed by
Fredrickson   et   al.   [65]),   so   that   the   duration   of   the   LKM
intervention could be comparable to that of the PER program.","","individuals  who  didn’t  participate  in  any  intervention  program

was more effective in women, whereas VGT was more effective in men. MT, but not VGT, decreased anxiety scores from before

""practices can be
grouped into two broad categories: focused attention (FA) and
open monitoring (OM) meditation. FA meditation entails volun-
tary and sustained attention on a specific focal point, such as
one’s breathing. OM meditation involves developing the ability
to monitor one’s own physical and mental states openly, and is
characterized by a meta-awareness of the ongoing contents of
one’s thoughts (Davidson & Kaszniak, 2015). Generally, FA is
cultivated as a prerequisite to OM (Davidson & Kaszniak, 2015;

was more effective in women, whereas VGT was more effective in men. MT, but not VGT, decreased anxiety scores from before

""practices can be
grouped into two broad categories: focused attention (FA) and
open monitoring (OM) meditation. FA meditation entails volun-

one’s breathing. OM meditation involves developing the ability
to monitor one’s own physical and mental states openly, and is
characterized by a meta-awareness of the ongoing contents of
one’s thoughts (Davidson & Kaszniak, 2015). Generally, FA is
cultivated as a prerequisite to OM (Davidson & Kaszniak, 2015;
Lutz et al., 2008).""

During the following days, you will repeat this exercise twice a day, for 20
minutes, before the morning and evening meals. If it is impossible at that
particular time, try to do it a little later.
Thus, you should find a calm and normally lit room, somewhere between bright
daylight and darkness. Try to avoid being disturbed during the exercise by
the telephone or any other loud noise.
Then, sit in the most comfortable position for you, your spinal cord straight
and leaning against a flat vertical surface, so as not t o fall asleep. Take care
to free your abdomen to facilitate respiration.
After that, close your eyes and wait half a minute before starting the exercise
itself which consists in counting your respiration (count 1 for inspiration and
expiration) from 1 to 10, and start again at 1, and so on. If you lose count
during the exercise, do not try to recall where you were but simply start over
at 1 and keep on.
During the course of the exercise, you will notice that thoughts, feelings,
sensory distractions will appear; you should not try t o fight these but wait
until it becomes easy to resume the exercise.
After 20 minutes, stop the exercise and wait 3 more minutes before opening
your eyes.
You will now do the exercise in my presence; when the 20 minutes are over,
I will let you know and you will reopen your eyes 3 minutes later. You can
start now .""

the one you have been practising over the past 15 days.
During the past 2 weeks, I asked you to count your respirations from 1 to 10.
Now you will stop counting in order to concentrate on the breathing process
itself. You will breathe as usual without any effort or restraint. Your attention
should be on your inspiration and expiration. Follow the entrance of the air
through the nose down to the lungs and from there toward the outside.
Your breathing may be long or short. This is not important. Breathe naturally.
The only important thing is that when your breathing is short, you are aware
of it and the same when it is long.
